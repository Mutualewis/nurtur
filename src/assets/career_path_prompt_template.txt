[ANALYSIS PROTOCOL]

You will analyze career potential through three distinct stages:

STAGE 1: Evidence Collection
- Extract genetic predispositions from parental traits (pre-birth only)
- Identify demonstrated abilities and interests from child data (post-birth)
- Note environmental supports and constraints
- Extract personality indicators and learning preferences
- Identify behavioral patterns and social tendencies

STAGE 2: Career Cluster Matching with Reasoning
- Match evidence to career cluster definitions
- Apply developmental psychology principles for age-appropriate analysis
- Consider multiple pathway possibilities simultaneously
- Document reasoning path for transparency
- Account for growth potential and emerging interests

STAGE 3: Confidence Scoring & Recommendations
- Evaluate evidence strength for each identified career cluster
- Calculate confidence scores based on evidence convergence
- Apply threshold filtering (minimum 0.65)
- Generate specific activity recommendations
- Format final output with actionable next steps

[PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS]

Analyze the following career prediction data using the three-stage process:

{input_data}

For your analysis:

1. If no career clusters match with confidence >= 0.65:
   {
       "career_clusters": [
           {
               "cluster": "INSUFFICIENT_DATA",
               "confidence": 0.0,
               "evidence": "Limited indicators available",
               "reasoning": "Not enough clear evidence to make reliable career cluster predictions (>= 0.65 confidence threshold)"
           }
       ]
   }

2. For valid predictions, maintain this exact format:
   {
       "prediction_type": "pre_birth/post_birth",
       "career_clusters": [
           {
               "cluster": "<cluster_name>",
               "confidence": <float >= 0.65>,
               "evidence": "<specific indicators from input>",
               "reasoning": "<developmental and psychological explanation>",
               "specific_career_paths": ["<career1>", "<career2>", "<career3>"],
               "recommended_activities": ["<activity1>", "<activity2>"],
               "skills_to_develop": ["<skill1>", "<skill2>"]
           }
       ],
       "developmental_timeline": {
           "next_6_months": "<immediate recommendations>",
           "next_12_months": "<medium-term goals>",
           "ages_X_Y": "<longer-term pathway>"
       }
   }

[CRITICAL RULES]

1. Only assign clusters with confidence ≥ 0.65
2. Always provide specific evidence from input data
3. Consider developmental appropriateness for child's age
4. Pre-birth predictions should focus on genetic predispositions and environmental preparation
5. Post-birth predictions should prioritize demonstrated abilities and interests
6. Include comparison with pre-birth predictions when both are available
7. Recommendations must be actionable and age-appropriate
8. Use child-friendly explanations in the reasoning sections
9. Account for multiple intelligence types in analysis
10. Consider cultural and socioeconomic factors in recommendations
